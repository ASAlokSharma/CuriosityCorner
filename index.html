                <h4>How Do Magnets Work?</h4>
                <p class="simple-answer"><strong>Simple Answer:</strong> Magnets have invisible forces that push and pull certain metals.</p>
                <p class="analogy"><strong>Think of it like:</strong> Imagine tiny invisible hands inside the magnet. Some hands want to hold metal things close (attract), and some want to push them away (repel).</p>
                <div class="steps">
                    <strong>How it works:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Magnets have two ends called North and South poles</li>
                        <li>Opposite poles (N + S) attract each other like best friends</li>
                        <li>Same poles (N + N or S + S) push away like they don't want to touch</li>
                        <li>They only work on special metals like iron</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p class="fun-fact"><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Earth is like one giant magnet! That's why compasses always point North.</p>

                <h4>Why Is the Sky Blue?</h4>
                <p class="simple-answer"><strong>Simple Answer:</strong> Sunlight bounces off tiny air particles and blue light spreads out the most.</p>
                <p class="analogy"><strong>Think of it like:</strong> Imagine throwing colorful bouncy balls at a wall. Blue balls bounce everywhere and fill the whole room, while red balls just go straight.</p>
                <div class="steps">
                    <strong>How it works:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sunlight has all the colors of the rainbow mixed together</li>
                        <li>When it hits air, the colors scatter (bounce around)</li>
                        <li>Blue light scatters the most because it's energetic</li>
                        <li>So we see blue everywhere in the sky!</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p class="fun-fact"><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> At sunset, the sky turns orange because blue light has scattered away and only red/orange reaches our eyes!</p>

                <h4>How Does WiFi Work?</h4>
                <p class="simple-answer"><strong>Simple Answer:</strong> WiFi sends invisible radio waves through the air to connect your devices to the internet.</p>
                <p class="analogy"><strong>Think of it like:</strong> Your WiFi router is like a lighthouse sending out invisible light waves. Your phone catches these waves and turns them into websites and videos.</p>
                <div class="steps">
                    <strong>How it works:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your router connects to the internet with a cable</li>
                        <li>It converts internet data into radio waves</li>
                        <li>These waves travel through the air</li>
                        <li>Your phone/laptop catches them and shows you websites!</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p class="fun-fact"><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> WiFi can't go through walls very well, just like shouting through a door makes it harder to hear!</p>

                <h4>What Is a QR Code?</h4>
                <p class="simple-answer"><strong>Simple Answer:</strong> A QR code is a special pattern of squares that stores information your phone can read.</p>
                <p class="analogy"><strong>Think of it like:</strong> It's like a secret code written in a special language that only cameras can understand and translate for you.</p>
                <div class="steps">
                    <strong>How it works:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Information (like a website link) is turned into a pattern</li>
                        <li>The pattern is made of black and white squares</li>
                        <li>Your phone camera scans the pattern</li>
                        <li>It decodes it back into the information!</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p class="fun-fact"><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> QR stands for "Quick Response" because they're super fast to scan!</p>

                <h4>Why Do Leaves Change Color?</h4>
                <p class="simple-answer"><strong>Simple Answer:</strong> Leaves change color in fall because they stop making green chlorophyll.</p>
                <p class="analogy"><strong>Think of it like:</strong> Imagine wearing a green jacket that hides your colorful shirt. When you take off the jacket (chlorophyll), everyone can see the colors underneath!</p>
                <div class="steps">
                    <strong>How it works:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Leaves have green chlorophyll that helps make food from sunlight</li>
                        <li>In fall, trees prepare for winter and stop making chlorophyll</li>
                        <li>The green fades away</li>
                        <li>Other colors (yellow, orange, red) that were always there show up!</li>
                    </ol>

                <h4>Why Do Stars Twinkle?</h4>
                <p class="simple-answer"><strong>Simple Answer:</strong> Stars twinkle because their light passes through moving air in Earth's atmosphere.</p>
                <p class="analogy"><strong>Think of it like:</strong> Looking at a coin at the bottom of a pool while someone makes waves. The coin seems to wiggle and shimmer, but it's not moving - the water is!</p>
                <div class="steps">
                    <strong>How it works:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stars send out steady light</li>
                        <li>The light travels through space (no twinkling yet)</li>
                        <li>When it hits Earth's atmosphere, moving air bends the light</li>
                        <li>This makes stars appear to twinkle!</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p class="fun-fact"><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Planets don't twinkle much because they're closer and look bigger, so the twinkling effect is less noticeable!</p>
